# auction-vs-continuous

# "Bids_energy_33.xlsx" containts all the bids (offers and requests) submitted for our study case.

# Running file "Scenarios_generation" implies generating a random arrival sequence of the bids and operating the continuous and auction-based LFM with and without considering block bids and network constraints. As output we obtain the total social welfare, energy volume traded and computational time.
